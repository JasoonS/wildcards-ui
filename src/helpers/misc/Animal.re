      "In the early hours of Sunday, the 20th May, the SANParks Section Ranger received a radio call from field rangers alerting him that a gunshot had been heard in the Skukuza section of the Kruger National Park. Helicopter support was deployed and soon after a deceased white rhino cow with a live calf was located.  Both horns had been removed from the cow and the calf had serious injuries to his back and right foot. Veterinarian Peter Buss stabilised the calf before it was transported by helicopter to Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary.",
      "At approximately 12:50 Care for Wild received notice that an injured calf was being airlifted to them and that they should be ready within ten minutes. They were. The small yet dedicated team at Care for Wild are on standby 24/7 and have strict protocols and procedures in place so that they are always ready to receive a rhino calf.",
      "This particular calf weighed in at just 80kgs. He was not dehydrated as he had drunk from his mother that same morning before she was killed. As he was still sedated, his wounds which were caused by a machete, were scrubbed cleaned and bandaged.",
      "He had a cut to his right front toenail which split the nail down to the nailbed, and a 4-inch gash on his back that cut through cartilage very close to his spine. It was instinctive for him to try and stay close to his mother to protect her, and the poachers with no sympathy or hesitation whatsoever lashed out at him so that they could finish their heinous crime of taking his mother's horn as quickly as possible.",
      "Petronel Nieuwoudt, the Founder of Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary, put in an urgent call to Dr. Nolene du Plessis, (Plastic Surgeon) and explained the situation. Dr. du Plessis came out to the sanctuary immediately to stitch the deep wound in his back closed.",
      "Just hours after his arrival and while still on the drip, he took his first bottle of milk! The jubilation felt by the staff was indescribable as this is a huge step in the extensive rehabilitation process. He continues to drink his milk and enjoy his grass as he grows day by day.",
      "He has been given the regal and brave name of Arthur, a name that suits his determination and spirit to survive.",
      "For months, his wounds were treated every 3-5 days, with the support of various veterinarians, surgeons, and wound care specialists. We are happy to say that Arthur's wound have now completely healed, and only the scars remain.",
      "Arthur has also made many friends at Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary. These include orphan rhino Summer (his best and most loyal friend), K9 puppy in training Looney, his boma-mates Sophia, Kayla-Milan and Sparkle, as well as some of the older orphans Fern, Rubybelle, Rose-Petal, Khanya, and Zac. Arthur enjoys his daily walks and naps on the grass lawns of Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary, together with Summer and the rest of his crash.",
      "It is truly a blessing to have little Arthur, The Brave, enjoying his new life, despite the horror he has experienced so early in his fragile life. Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary would like to thank everyone involved in Arthur's rescue, his wound and general care. The love and support Arthur has received has made an amazing difference in this little orphaned rhino's life. Thank you.",

English-speaking people call me African Black Oystercatcher, but that is too much of a mouthful, so I am Abo for short.",
      "I live on Robben Island, and have been doing so for about 30 years. I am now one of the oldest oystercatchers on the island. The institutional memory resides with me.",
      "I was hatched here. My parents looked after me until I was a few months old. They showed me how to get mussels off the rocks. It's not an easy thing to do. But once I mastered this technique, they got nasty, and chased me out their territory. I headed north along the coast. I dunno why I headed north; it was just instinctive I suppose. I just kept going. Eventually I reached a coast where there was absolutely no vegetation on the land whatsoever. This didn't bug me, because there is nothing on land to interest me. What did bug me were the brownish furry animals on the beaches. They seemed quite nasty to me. Eventually, on an offshore island, I spotted a gang of birds that looked just like me: black bodies with red beaks. I teamed up with them. We were a great flock of youngsters; the feeding was good and we kept out of the way of the three pairs of grumpy grown-ups who bred on the island.",
      "A couple of years later, the urge to move again hit me. This time I headed south, back to Robben Island. At that time it was easy to find a territory. There were not too many of us. I found a mate. We had chicks each year. They were damned hard work, and even once they could fly we had to keep feeding them, because their beaks were not strong enough to open up mussels and limpets. The moment they were able to fend for themselves, we sent them packing. I am on my third partner now.",
      "When I started life, the intertidal zone was a struggle. You lot thought that we were on our way to extinction. But then a new kind of mussel appeared, which grew faster, and high up the shore. Life became easier. We had more and more chicks each summer. After a few years they come back, and make a helluva nuisance of themselves. I call them hooligans. There are hundreds of them. How much longer I can hold out against them at my age I don't know. It's me they want out, and to take over my mate. I've not left my territory for decades; if I do, I am a gonner. I am imprisoned on my territory, kept inside it by the hooligans. But I guess you will say that that is not an inappropriate statement to make on Robben Island.",

Macaws and especially Blue-and-Yellow macaws have been an all time favourite for the pet trade market. They are very smart birds and in comparison to other wildlife, are easily domesticated. They are beloved because of their intelligence, their ability to imitate sounds, their beauty and their companionship.",
      "In countries like the United States, Blue-and-Yellow Macaws are raised as pets and a legal pet market exists for them. This is not the case in Bolivia however. There are absolutely no regulations on the matter and all pet parrots and macaws come from the illegal market. This means that they were stolen when chicks from their nests and went through a lot of suffering being transported illegally in hide-outs where they can barely breathe. Once with their final owners, their life is not always the best. Most parrot and macaw owners in Bolivia have no knowledge on the dietary and life requirements for these animals and they normally survive in very precarious conditions. Many of them are kept in La Paz, where low temperatures and high altitude are far from the suitable environment they need.",
      "When macaws like Verano arrive to La Senda Verde, they normally do so with their plumage deteriorated and with signs of psychological trauma. They go through a long recovery phase until they can be finally released into our new large aviaries, where they receive all the attention they need.",

The smallest one fell a bit behind. The trucker decided to stop, capture the cub and take him to his house, where he kept him for more than two weeks. Later he called the environmental authorities in the City of Tarija to turn him in. Capturing the cub is never a good idea, it is virtually condemning him to a life in captivity for he will never be able to learn the abilities to survive in the wild his mother would have taught him. If he would have been left alone, the mother would have come back for him later.",
      "Tarkus stayed in Tarija for three weeks while the formal requirements were fulfilled. National authorities advised he should be sent to La Senda Verde, where there is a place for the cub, but also the experience of raising bear cubs with appropriate diet and management. He has been placed in a 6x5x6 enclosure, just for him, and he has been getting used to the refuge and the caretakers.",

      "The family has a cattle ranch, and one of the cowboys in the ranch had found her in a very bad state of health laying in the forest, with a wound in her head, full of skin parasites and parts of her body without skin. They picked her up and started rehabilitating her. First they fed her the wrong food, then they realised they needed to feed her meat. It wasn't until she arrived with Senda Verde that she was able to drink cat milk, for she was so small she really needed it.",
      "The cub was partially rehabilitated by the family but still had some difficulties when she arrived at Senda Verde. She couldn't walk very well and her stomach was swollen. Just like the Andean Bear cub Tarkus that arrived around the same time Mijungla did, this Jaguar cub spent very little time with her mother, which affects them greatly both psychologically and physiologically. Senda Verde monitors very closely both cub's digestion since they could get sick since they did not get enough milk from their mothers.",

They are also both foragers and get along well.",

At the time La Senda Verde didn't have anywhere suitable to accommodate her and as a small kitten she spent her first few months in the clinic. La Senda Verde raised funds and built her a management cage whilst she was still growing. Then, at the beginning of 2017 they completed her full sized enclosure with high platforms, on a hill so she can get to higher ground and with a den at the top that she loves to sit in and watch out from.",
      "Espumita has always been quite a shy and easily stressed cat but loves her new home. In December Espumita had unfortunately been under stress and was pacing a lot due to recent construction works going on close to her enclosure. Unfortunately, Espumita also wasn't eating very well and had lost condition. Eight weeks ago, la Senda Verde sedated her and a visiting group of vets studying ultrasonography came and performed an ultrasound on her and we were able to give her a thorough check. It was found that she likely had some mild hepatic lipidosis (a form of liver disease) which was also contributing to her loss of appetite.",
      "Along with one of the sanctuary staff members, Vicky from Senda Verde started to add in extra enrichment every day for Espumita and slightly change the time and way in which she was fed. Luckily, at this time the construction was also finished. Over the next eight weeks there was an amazing transformation! Espumita started to eat normally, gain weight and is noticeably more relaxed and confident. She comes down to greet the staff from la Senda Verde every time they go for enrichment or cleaning and feeding (which she never did before) and Senda Verde hasn't seen her do any pacing that she was doing before.",
      "She absolutely loves cardboard boxes of any shape or size! La Senda Verde started off with relaxing smells such as chamomile flowers and lavender in cardboard boxes. They have also been using feathers which she loves. She is still a huge fan of lavender and will roll in it and will then often have a mad ten minutes running all over her enclosure with the box and up on her platforms having so much fun.",

      "Cubai is a 15 year old Jaguar that in 2017 was relocated from a private property in the Yungas region to the La Paz Zoo. The animal was in good hands, but his advanced age mixed with the cold weather and the high altitude of La Paz, were beginning to affect his health, he needed a lower place to live in.",
      "It was then that the authorities asked Senda Verde if they could receive him. In face of the urgency they decided to do so and make him part of their family. Cubai arrived on the 20th of November and at the beginning was being kept in a small, temporary enclosure, while la senda verde gathered funds to build him a proper enclosure.",
      "Luckily he didn't stay there for long. A few months were enough to build a brand new enclosure, with management cage, platform, pool, the whole works! The place where it's located has a lot of trees, vegetation and is near the river. He now spends his days playing around and enjoying a space he never had before in his lifetime.",

  | CatStevens => [|
      "Cat Stevens is a male Ocelot that was rescued by an engineer working at the San Buenaventura sugar factory. This Factory was finished in 2016 and was built in the middle of the northern Madidi forests, just outside the national park. There is no suitable land to grow sugar cane to feed this factory, so they have simply chosen to destroy the nearby primary rainforest for that. So far 1,200 hectares have been destroyed to lay way for the cane plantations, and many more are coming. Thousands of animals have seen their homes destroyed before their eyes. Cat Stevens is one of them. Clear-cutting of the forest happened so fast (two years) that these animals didn't have time to run somewhere else or fall prey to local bush-meat hunters. They simply where left there to wonder in what once was a forest.",
      "Cat Stevens was a baby then seen wondering around in a empty field by one of the engineers. He had probably lost his mother and was probably going to die if he wasn't rescued by the engineer. Cat Stevens was a small cat when he arrived. He was underweight and la Senda Verde noticed he could not walk too well, but assumed it was because of age and undernourishment. After a month, he gained weight and suddenly stopped walking. He was taken to La Paz for X-ray and noticed he had an old fracture that would not heal due to decalcification. After a couple of weeks of feeding him with cat formula, he recovered and started to walk again. Cat Stevens was alone for a few months until Cat Iris arrival, a female ocelot. They where put together and get along well.",

  | Aruma => [|
      "Aruma was the first bear to arrive at la Senda Verde and was the game-changer for them. After he arrived they knew that our mission was to shelter and rescue animals. Aruma means 'night' in Aymara language.",
      "A little boy and his dad had stumbled in the forest upon a mother bear with two cubs. The mother and one of the cubs ran away but the other cub stood there frozen. The cub was taken by the little boy and he tried to sell it in the town of Quime. The doctor in town noticed that the cub had terrible diarrhea, called the police and the bear cub was confiscated from the little boy. The doctor arrived in La Paz at 4 am, and called Animals SOS. Aruma stayed with a volunteer for 2 months while he was getting medical treatment, until he was sent to La Senda Verde in December 2007.",

  | Apthapi => [|
      "Apthapi arrived at La Senda Verde with 8-10 months of age along with a female deer of the same age. They came from a confiscation performed by the Forestry and Environment Police (POFOMA) in Palos Blancos, North of La Paz. The tapir is the largest mammal in South America. They are known to be the \'gardeners of the forest\' because they are nutrient recyclers. They are also excellent swimmers.",

  | Ajayu => [|
      "Ajayu was saved by the police in Cochabamba from being brutally beaten to death by a local nearby community in 2016. He arrived in La Paz and La Senda Verde took care of his treatments. He received several surgeries, one to save his left eye and one to save his jaw from a severe infection. He stopped eating for days and had to be force fed. It was a struggle to save him, but with time he got better and now weighs 100 kilograms.",
      "As a result of this brutality, la Senda Verde is more involved in trying to change legislation in Bolivia to protect this species and prevent stories like this from happening again. They are now working alongside biologist Ximena Velez-Liendo to present a law project that will be called the Ajayu law, named after this bear. Ajayu means spirit in Aymara language.",

Though spotted hyenas can be difficult to see in this area, Nonhlanhla is a particularly great breeder in her clan having cubs regularly, meaning she is seen often at the den site nursing her young. In an area where spotted hyenas are persecuted and there is evidence for their decline, her name in Zulu, appropriately means \"luck\".",

However, Darwin Animal Doctors local partner team, the Indonesian Species Conservation Program (ISCP) rescued him from the black market. Ucok is now being rehabilitated at the BKSDA - the Indonesian wildlife authority. Ucok is understandably often quite sad, because he misses his mom. But, he regularly overcomes his sadness to be an extremely curious and inquisitive boy and he loves to test his rehab team's boundaries! He is quite mischievous, which tells us he's a smart boy!",

Unexpectedly nature was prospering, the villagers were in hiding and the flora and fauna of the region was reclaiming its land. Most unexpectedly the dragon returned, which for a long time was believed to be extinct. Glen the Dragon of Turin emerged from the Alps just North of the city. One of the last of his kind.",
